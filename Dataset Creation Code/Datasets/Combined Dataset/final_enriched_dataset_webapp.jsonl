This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass” property available on all Java “enum” objects. Accessing the enum’s “declaredClass” allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().\nStarting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the “declaredClass” property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils\n\n 1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n\nUsers of the artifact org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2\n\n 2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.", "exploits": [], "fixes": [{"source": "nvd-ref", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/s0hb3jkfj5f3ryx6c57zqtfohb0of1g9", "tags": ["Vendor Advisory", "Mailing List"]}]}

In ImageMagick versions prior to 7.1.2-7 and 6.9.13-32, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP decoder on 32-bit systems. The vulnerability occurs in coders/bmp.c when calculating the extent value by multiplying image columns by bits per pixel. On 32-bit systems with size_t of 4 bytes, a malicious BMP file with specific dimensions can cause this multiplication to overflow and wrap to zero. The overflow check added to address CVE-2025-57803 is placed after the overflow occurs, making it ineffective. A specially crafted 58-byte BMP file with width set to 536,870,912 and 32 bits per pixel can trigger this overflow, causing the bytes_per_line calculation to become zero. This vulnerability only affects 32-bit builds of ImageMagick where default resource limits for width, height, and area have been manually increased beyond their defaults. 64-bit systems with size_t of 8 bytes are not vulnerable, and systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are not vulnerable.

This does rely on interrupts\nremaining disabled for the entire duration of the switch.\n\nThis condition is guaranteed for normal process creation and context\nswitching between already running processes, because both 'prev' and\n'next' already have interrupts disabled in their saved copies of the\nstatus register.\n\nThe situation is different for newly created kernel threads.  The status\nregister is set to PS_S in copy_thread(), which does leave the IPL at 0.\nUpon restoring the 'next' thread's status register in switch_to() aka\nresume(), interrupts then become enabled prematurely.  resume() then\nreturns via ret_from_kernel_thread() and schedule_tail() where run queue\nlock is released (see finish_task_switch() and finish_lock_switch()).\n\nA timer interrupt calling scheduler_tick() before the lock is released\nin finish_task_switch() will find the lock already taken, with the\ncurrent task as lock owner.  This causes a spinlock recursion warning as\nreported by Guenter Roeck.\n\nAs far as I can ascertain, this race has been opened in commit\n533e6903bea0 (\"m68k: split ret_from_fork(), simplify kernel_thread()\")\nbut I haven't done a detailed study of kernel history so it may well\npredate that commit.\n\nInterrupts cannot be disabled in the saved status register copy for\nkernel threads (init will complain about interrupts disabled when\nfinally starting user space).  Disable interrupts temporarily when\nswitching the tasks' register sets in resume().\n\nNote that a simple oriw 0x700,%sr after restoring sr is not enough here\n- this leaves enough of a race for the 'spinlock recursion' warning to\nstill be observed.\n\nTested on ARAnyM and qemu (Quadra 800 emulation).", "exploits": [], "fixes": [{"source": "nvd-ref", "url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0d9ae1253535f6e85a016e09c25ecbe6f7f59ef0", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"source": "nvd-ref", "url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2a8d1d95302c7d52c6ac8fa5cb4a6948ae0d3a14", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"source": "nvd-ref", "url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4eeffecc8e3cce25bb559502c2fd94a948bcde82", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"source": "nvd-ref", "url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5213cc01d0464c011fdc09f318705603ed3a746b", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"source": "nvd-ref", "url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/77b2b67a0f8bce260c53907e5749d61466d90c87", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"source": "nvd-ref", "url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/95f00caf767b5968c2c51083957b38be4748a78a", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"source": "nvd-ref", "url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/da89ce46f02470ef08f0f580755d14d547da59ed", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"source": "nvd-ref", "url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1d4274a84c069be0f6098ab10c3443fc1f7134c", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"source": "nvd-ref", "url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f3baf0f4f92af32943ebf27b960e0552c6c082fd", "tags": ["Patch"]}]}

However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may\nneed to issue commands to a device to obtain limit values from the\nhardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA\ndeadlock situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing\nthe device queue) while the device driver starts a revalidation of the\ndevice queue limits.\n\nAvoid such deadlock by not freezing the queue before calling the\n->store_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and instead use the\nqueue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking\nthe limits lock.\n\nThis also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as\nit doesn't protect anything here, but creates even more nesting.\nHopefully it will go away from the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.\n\n(commit log adapted from a similar patch from  Damien Le Moal)", "exploits": [], "fixes": []}

In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from\nthe buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the\nppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor\nmode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is\ncaptured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.\n\nWhen the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is\nactivated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics,\nthe driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter\nconfiguration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and\nkzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a\nmemory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while\nenabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while\nenabling extended statistics mode in the driver.\n\nFix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in\nthe HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone\nmonitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs.\nThese TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor\nmode in the future.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3", "exploits": [], "fixes": []}

The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in br_multicast_add_router.part.0+0x3f1/0x560\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffff888004a67328 by task ip/384\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n dump_stack\n---truncated---", "exploits": [], "fixes": []}

The problem is the following in the values passed to the\nsubsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call given a tbf parent:\n\n   When the tbf parent runs out of tokens, skbs of these qdiscs will\n   be placed in gso_skb. Their peek handlers are qdisc_peek_dequeued,\n   which accounts for both qlen and backlog. However, in the case of\n   qdisc_dequeue_internal, ONLY qlen is accounted for when pulling\n   from gso_skb. This means that these qdiscs are missing a\n   qdisc_qstats_backlog_dec when dropping packets to satisfy the\n   new limit in their change handlers.\n\n   One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to\n   support a limit of 0):\n\n   export TARGET=fq\n   tc qdisc del dev lo root\n   tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000\n   echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2>&1 >/dev/null\n   echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0\n   echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq\n   echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n\n   The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive\n   number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the\n   last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers\n   qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an\n   underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0).\n\nTo fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal\nhas been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel.\nqdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that\ndo not directly use the dequeue handler.\n\nThe old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to\nthe subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field.\nHowever, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also\npotentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the\nnon gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs.", "exploits": [], "fixes": []}

{"cve_id": "CVE-2025-39948", "package": "linux-libc-dev", "version": "6.12.48-1", "severity": "HIGH", "title": "kernel: ice: fix Rx page leak on multi-buffer frames", "primary_url": "https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2025-39948", "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: fix Rx page leak on multi-buffer frames\n\nThe ice_put_rx_mbuf() function handles calling ice_put_rx_buf() for each\nbuffer in the current frame. This function was introduced as part of\nhandling multi-buffer XDP support in the ice driver.\n\nIt works by iterating over the buffers from first_desc up to 1 plus the\ntotal number of fragments in the frame, cached from before the XDP program\nwas executed.\n\nIf the hardware posts a descriptor with a size of 0, the logic used in\nice_put_rx_mbuf() breaks. Such descriptors get skipped and don't get added\nas fragments in ice_add_xdp_frag. Since the buffer isn't counted as a\nfragment, we do not iterate over it in ice_put_rx_mbuf(), and thus we don't\ncall ice_put_rx_buf().\n\nBecause we don't call ice_put_rx_buf(), we don't attempt to re-use the\npage or free it. This leaves a stale page in the ring, as we don't\nincrement next_to_alloc.\n\nThe ice_reuse_rx_page() assumes that the next_to_alloc has been incremented\nproperly, and that it always points to a buffer with a NULL page. Since\nthis function doesn't check, it will happily recycle a page over the top\nof the next_to_alloc buffer, losing track of the old page.\n\nNote that this leak only occurs for multi-buffer frames. The\nice_put_rx_mbuf() function always handles at least one buffer, so a\nsingle-buffer frame will always get handled correctly. It is not clear\nprecisely why the hardware hands us descriptors with a size of 0 sometimes,\nbut it happens somewhat regularly with \"jumbo frames\" used by 9K MTU.\n\nTo fix ice_put_rx_mbuf(), we need to make sure to call ice_put_rx_buf() on\nall buffers between first_desc and next_to_clean. Borrow the logic of a\nsimilar function in i40e used for this same purpose. Use the same logic\nalso in ice_get_pgcnts().\n\nInstead of iterating over just the number of fragments, use a loop which\niterates until the current index reaches to the next_to_clean element just\npast the current frame. Unlike i40e, the ice_put_rx_mbuf() function does\ncall ice_put_rx_buf() on the last buffer of the frame indicating the end of\npacket.\n\nFor non-linear (multi-buffer) frames, we need to take care when adjusting\nthe pagecnt_bias. An XDP program might release fragments from the tail of\nthe frame, in which case that fragment page is already released. Only\nupdate the pagecnt_bias for the first descriptor and fragments still\nremaining post-XDP program. Take care to only access the shared info for\nfragmented buffers, as this avoids a significant cache miss.\n\nThe xdp_xmit value only needs to be updated if an XDP program is run, and\nonly once per packet. Drop the xdp_xmit pointer argument from\nice_put_rx_mbuf(). Instead, set xdp_xmit in the ice_clean_rx_irq() function\ndirectly. This avoids needing to pass the argument and avoids an extra\nbit-wise OR for each buffer in the frame.\n\nMove the increment of the ntc local variable to ensure its updated *before*\nall calls to ice_get_pgcnts() or ice_put_rx_mbuf(), as the loop logic\nrequires the index of the element just after the current frame.\n\nNow that we use an index pointer in the ring to identify the packet, we no\nlonger need to track or cache the number of fragments in the rx_ring.", "exploits": [], "fixes": []}

Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages).
